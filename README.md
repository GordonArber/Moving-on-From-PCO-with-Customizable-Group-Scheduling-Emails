# Moving on-From PCO with Customizable Group Scheduling Emails

## Why

When our organization wanted to move all our volunteer scheduling from PCO to Rock, we knew it would be vital to give ministry Pastors the ability to customize emails. These emails would be for their ministry at their campus before sending out their group scheduling notifications.

Giving ministry Pastors the ability to customize their emails gives each of them a voice in their emails instead of just a canned response. It also lets them inform their volunteers about exciting news, training videos, or what to expect this weekend without needing to reach out to anyone with administrative rights to change and update the email content.
